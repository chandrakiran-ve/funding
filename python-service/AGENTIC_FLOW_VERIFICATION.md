# Agentic Flow Verification

This document explains how to verify that our LangGraph AI agent is truly agentic and not just following fixed NLP patterns.

## What Makes This Truly Agentic?

Our implementation follows this flow:

**User Query ‚Üí AI analyzes and creates reasoning plan ‚Üí Tool Selection ‚Üí AI decides what data to fetch and how ‚Üí Data Analysis ‚Üí AI performs intelligent analysis on the data ‚Üí Response Generation ‚Üí AI creates comprehensive, contextual responses**

### Key Agentic Components:

1. **AIReasoningNode**: Uses Gemini AI to understand queries and create detailed reasoning plans
2. **AIToolExecutionNode**: Dynamically selects and executes tools based on AI decisions
3. **AIResponseGenerationNode**: Generates contextual responses using full workflow context

## How to Verify the Agentic Flow

### Method 1: Run the Test Script

```bash
cd python-service
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
python test_agentic_flow.py
```

This will test various queries and show you:
- ‚úÖ AI Reasoning: The AI's step-by-step plan
- ‚úÖ Tool Selection: What data the AI decided to fetch and why
- ‚úÖ Data Analysis: How the AI chose to analyze the data
- ‚úÖ Response Generation: The final contextual response

### Method 2: Use the API Endpoints

Start the service:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Test the agentic flow:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/langgraph/test-agentic-flow" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test_query": "What are the top 5 funders in California?"}'
```

### Method 3: Interactive Chat

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/langgraph/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Which states are performing best against their fundraising targets?",
    "session_id": "test-session"
  }'
```

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ True Agentic Behavior:
- **Dynamic Reasoning**: AI creates different plans for different queries
- **Adaptive Tool Selection**: AI chooses different data sources based on the query
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI determines analysis approach based on data and context
- **Contextual Responses**: Responses reference the AI's reasoning process

### ‚ùå Fixed Pattern Behavior (What We Avoided):
- Same data fetching regardless of query
- Fixed analysis types (always sum, always count, etc.)
- Template-based responses
- No reasoning or decision-making process

## Example Agentic Flow

**Query**: "What are the top 5 funders by contribution amount?"

1. **AI Reasoning**: 
   - "User wants to rank funders by total contributions"
   - "I need funder data and contribution data"
   - "I'll sum contributions by funder, then rank them"

2. **Tool Selection**:
   - Fetches funders data (no filters needed)
   - Fetches contributions data (no filters needed)
   - Plans to use "sum" and "top_n" analysis

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculates total contributions per funder
   - Ranks funders by total amount
   - Identifies top 5 performers

4. **Response Generation**:
   - Creates response with specific numbers
   - Explains methodology
   - Provides actionable insights

## Verification Checklist

When testing, verify these agentic behaviors:

- [ ] AI creates different reasoning plans for different queries
- [ ] Tool selection varies based on query requirements
- [ ] Data fetching strategy adapts to the specific question
- [ ] Analysis approach changes based on what the user is asking
- [ ] Responses reference the AI's decision-making process
- [ ] The workflow can handle unexpected or complex queries
- [ ] AI can ask clarification questions when needed
- [ ] Error recovery uses intelligent strategies

## Technical Implementation Details

### AI-Powered Nodes:

1. **AIReasoningNode** (`query_workflow.py:300-400`)
   - Uses Gemini AI to analyze queries
   - Creates step-by-step reasoning plans
   - Determines next workflow actions

2. **AIToolExecutionNode** (`query_workflow.py:420-600`)
   - Interprets AI reasoning to select tools
   - Dynamically fetches relevant data
   - Performs AI-guided analysis

3. **AIResponseGenerationNode** (`query_workflow.py:700-800`)
   - Uses full workflow context
   - Generates intelligent, contextual responses
   - References AI's reasoning process

### LangGraph Workflow Structure:

```python
workflow.add_edge(START, "ai_reasoning")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "ai_reasoning",
    self._route_after_reasoning,  # AI decides next step
    {
        "execute_tools": "tool_execution",
        "generate_response": "response_generation",
        "end": END
    }
)
```

This confirms we have implemented a **TRUE AGENTIC WORKFLOW** that uses AI for decision-making at every step, not just pattern matching or fixed rules! üéØ

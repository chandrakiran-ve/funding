# ü§ñ **AI Data Modification System**

## **Overview**
The AI assistant now has the ability to **safely modify your Google Sheets data** with full revert/undo capabilities. This system provides enterprise-grade data management with comprehensive safety features, change tracking, and backup/restore functionality.

## **üîí Safety Features**

### **1. Risk Assessment**
- **Low Risk**: Simple create operations (new contributions, prospects)
- **Medium Risk**: Update operations, single record deletions
- **High Risk**: Bulk operations affecting multiple records
- **Critical Risk**: Database-wide operations (erase all data)

### **2. Automatic Backups**
- **Pre-operation snapshots**: Automatic backup before any high-risk operation
- **Change tracking**: Every modification is recorded with full details
- **Revert capability**: Every change can be safely undone
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of all data modifications

### **3. Confirmation System**
- **Required confirmations**: High and critical risk operations need explicit confirmation
- **Clear warnings**: Detailed descriptions of what will be affected
- **Operation IDs**: Each pending operation has a unique identifier
- **Cancellation support**: Users can cancel pending operations

## **üìù Available Operations**

### **Create Operations**
```bash
"Add a contribution of ‚Çπ50,000 from XYZ Foundation to Karnataka"
"Create a new prospect for ABC Corp in Tamil Nadu worth ‚Çπ1,00,000"
"Add a state target of ‚Çπ2,000,000 for Kerala in FY25-26"
```

### **Update Operations**
```bash
"Update contribution amount to ‚Çπ75,000 for contribution ID xyz"
"Change the stage of prospect ID abc to Committed"
"Update the target for Karnataka to ‚Çπ3,000,000"
```

### **Delete Operations**
```bash
"Delete prospect with ID xyz"
"Remove all prospects in Lead stage older than 3 months"
"Delete contribution ID abc"
```

### **Bulk Operations**
```bash
"Delete all prospects in Lead stage"
"Update all contribution amounts by 10% for FY24-25"
"Change all prospects from Contacted to Proposal stage"
```

### **Revert Operations**
```bash
"Revert change ID xyz"
"Undo the last operation"
"Revert change-1234567890"
```

### **Backup & Restore**
```bash
"Create a backup of current data"
"Show available snapshots"
"Restore from backup ID xyz"
```

### **Dangerous Operations**
```bash
"Erase all data"  # Requires confirmation + creates backup first
"Delete all contributions"  # High risk + requires confirmation
"Remove all prospects"  # High risk + requires confirmation
```

## **üîÑ Revert/Undo System**

### **How It Works**
1. **Change Recording**: Every operation is recorded with a unique ID and full details
2. **Revert Data**: Sufficient information is stored to completely undo the operation
3. **Safety Checks**: The system verifies that revert is possible before proceeding
4. **Cache Invalidation**: After revert, all data caches are refreshed

### **Revert Commands**
```bash
# Revert by change ID
"Revert change-1234567890"

# Revert the last operation
"Undo the last operation"

# Revert a specific type of operation
"Revert the last prospect deletion"
```

### **What Can Be Reverted**
- ‚úÖ Single record creation
- ‚úÖ Single record updates
- ‚úÖ Single record deletions
- ‚úÖ Bulk operations
- ‚úÖ Data imports
- ‚ùå Database restoration (cannot be reverted)
- ‚ùå Manual sheet edits (not tracked by system)

## **üìä Status & Monitoring**

### **Status Information**
The AI provides real-time status information:
```bash
# Get current status
"What's the current status of data operations?"

# See recent changes
"Show me recent changes"

# Check available backups
"What backups are available?"
```

### **Status Response Example**
```
üìä Current Status:
- Recent Changes: 5
- Revertable Changes: 4
- Available Snapshots: 3
- Pending Operations: 1
```

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines**

1. **Immediate Action**: Stop all operations
2. **Check Backups**: Identify the most recent good backup
3. **Restore Process**: Use "Restore from backup ID xyz"
4. **Verify Data**: Check data integrity after restore
5. **Document Incident**: Record what happened and how it was resolved

### **Accidental Deletions**
1. **Quick Revert**: Use "Revert change ID" if available
2. **Check History**: Look for the deletion in recent changes
3. **Restore Backup**: If revert isn't available, restore from backup
4. **Data Verification**: Ensure all data is properly restored

### **System Issues**

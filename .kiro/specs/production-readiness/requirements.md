5. WHEN invalid data is encountered THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing valid data
6. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
7. WHEN concurrent requests exceed limits THEN the system SHALL implement proper queuing mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times and efficient resource usage, so that I can get quick answers to my queries without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are processed THEN response time SHALL be under 5 seconds for simple queries
2. WHEN complex analysis is performed THEN response time SHALL be under 15 seconds
3. WHEN data is fetched from Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
5. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and streaming
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL batch requests where possible
7. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection optimization

### Requirement 4: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can track system health, debug issues, and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL log all API requests with response times and status codes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN comprehensive health endpoints SHALL be available
5. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL track usage analytics
6. WHEN alerts are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with alerting systems
7. WHEN debugging is required THEN structured logging SHALL provide searchable information

### Requirement 5: Deployment Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment and infrastructure management, so that I can deploy updates safely and scale the system as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN automated CI/CD pipelines SHALL run tests and deploy to staging
2. WHEN deployment is ready THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading without restarts
5. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN the system SHALL support quick rollback mechanisms
6. WHEN environments are managed THEN proper staging/production separation SHALL exist
7. WHEN secrets are managed THEN secure secret management systems SHALL be used

### Requirement 6: Data Management and Backup

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want proper data management and backup strategies, so that data is protected and recoverable in case of failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL implement cache invalidation strategies
2. WHEN data changes THEN the system SHALL detect and refresh stale data automatically
3. WHEN backups are needed THEN the system SHALL implement automated backup procedures
4. WHEN data recovery is required THEN the system SHALL provide data restoration capabilities
5. WHEN data retention is managed THEN the system SHALL implement proper data lifecycle policies
6. WHEN data privacy is required THEN the system SHALL implement data anonymization features
7. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all data access and modifications

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage and quality checks, so that I can ensure the system works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN unit tests SHALL cover at least 80% of the codebase
2. WHEN integration points exist THEN integration tests SHALL verify external service interactions
3. WHEN performance is critical THEN load tests SHALL validate system capacity
4. WHEN security is important THEN security tests SHALL check for vulnerabilities
5. WHEN deployments happen THEN smoke tests SHALL verify basic functionality
6. WHEN code quality matters THEN static analysis SHALL enforce coding standards
7. WHEN documentation is needed THEN API documentation SHALL be automatically generated

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration management, so that I can adjust system behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configs
2. WHEN settings change THEN the system SHALL validate configuration values
3. WHEN features are toggled THEN the system SHALL support feature flags
4. WHEN limits are set THEN the system SHALL enforce configurable rate limits and quotas
5. WHEN integrations are configured THEN the system SHALL validate external service connections
6. WHEN defaults are needed THEN the system SHALL provide sensible default configurations
7. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AI assistant with LangGraph capabilities implemented in Python, providing advanced conversational AI workflows and comprehensive CRUD operations on fundraising data. The enhancement will replace the current simplified TypeScript agent with a sophisticated Python-based LangGraph agent that can handle complex multi-step reasoning, maintain conversation state, and perform data operations with better accuracy and context awareness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fundraising manager, I want an AI assistant powered by LangGraph that can understand complex queries and perform multi-step reasoning, so that I can get more accurate and contextual insights from my fundraising data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a complex question requiring multiple data sources THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph workflows to break down the query into logical steps
2. WHEN the AI processes a query THEN it SHALL maintain conversation context and state throughout the interaction
3. WHEN multiple data analysis steps are required THEN the system SHALL execute them in the correct sequence using LangGraph nodes
4. IF a query requires clarification THEN the system SHALL ask follow-up questions before proceeding
5. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL provide reasoning for its conclusions and cite data sources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want the AI assistant to perform CRUD operations on fundraising data through natural language commands, so that I can manage data efficiently without using complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to create new data entries THEN the system SHALL validate the data and create records in the appropriate Google Sheets
2. WHEN a user asks to update existing records THEN the system SHALL identify the correct records and apply the requested changes
3. WHEN a user requests to delete data THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and safely remove the specified records
4. WHEN performing any CRUD operation THEN the system SHALL log the changes and provide confirmation to the user
5. IF a CRUD operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest corrective actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the LangGraph agent to seamlessly integrate with the existing Next.js application, so that users can access enhanced AI capabilities without disrupting current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python LangGraph service starts THEN it SHALL expose REST API endpoints compatible with the existing TypeScript interface
2. WHEN the Next.js application makes AI requests THEN the system SHALL route them to the Python LangGraph service
3. WHEN the LangGraph service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the existing TypeScript agent
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the response format SHALL remain consistent with current API contracts
5. WHEN the system starts THEN both services SHALL initialize without conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fundraising analyst, I want the AI to provide advanced analytics and predictive insights using LangGraph's workflow capabilities, so that I can make data-driven decisions with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph workflows to combine historical data analysis with predictive modeling
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL provide confidence levels and supporting evidence
3. WHEN comparing performance metrics THEN the system SHALL automatically identify relevant benchmarks and context
4. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL investigate potential causes using multi-step reasoning
5. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL explain the methodology and assumptions used

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want all AI operations to be secure and auditable, so that I can ensure data privacy and compliance with organizational policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user requests THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize all operations
2. WHEN accessing Google Sheets data THEN the system SHALL use secure API credentials and encrypted connections
3. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit log of all changes
4. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL not log or expose personally identifiable information
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them securely without exposing sensitive details to users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the LangGraph service to be containerized and easily deployable, so that I can manage it efficiently in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the service THEN it SHALL run in a Docker container with all dependencies included
2. WHEN configuring the service THEN it SHALL use environment variables for all configuration settings
3. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL perform health checks and report readiness status
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the service SHALL support horizontal scaling without state conflicts
5. WHEN monitoring the service THEN it SHALL provide metrics and logging for observability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms in the LangGraph workflows, so that the system remains robust and provides helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow step fails THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery using predefined strategies
2. WHEN data access fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and inform the user of delays
3. WHEN AI model requests fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and suggest alternatives
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to correct the input
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical operations and queue others
